# GuitarPracticer
I suck at guitar and need a tool for help me practice and I can write code....so.....yeah.

I reserve the right to (re)write this in whatever language/framework I want (Elm, VanillaJS, React, Reason, who knows!?!). 
The goal is for this thing to be a static bunble I can serve
from AWS to help me structure my guitar practice routine. Also, let's be real, the point is for this tool to be a quick way for me to practice guitar, not to be a feat of engineering or the most beautiful app ever. Not to say it can't or won't be beautiful, but that isn't the goal.

If you want to try it, knock yourself out. If it's a useful to you as it is to me, happy to help!

# Designed as a low ceremoney way to practice the following

## Fretboard knowledge game
Randomly generate a note and a reference fret for the first finger. Find the note nearest (but above) that fret on any string.
The actual note will play in the background (but perhaps in a different octave) to make sure you've got it right.
You simply chose a time (in seconds) you have to get the note. You can reduce this as your command of the fretboard improves.

## Arpeggio training
Randomly generate a chord. The actual chord will play in the background for reference. The intended practice is 
a chord will randomly select and will play. You will select a reference fret and "play the changes" as they come while
moving as little as possible from that location.
You simply chose a time (in seconds) for you to play to play the chord/arpeggio. 
You can reduce this time as your comping skills approach those of Coltrane.
