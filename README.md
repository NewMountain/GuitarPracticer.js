# GuitarPracticer
I suck at guitar and need a tool for help me practice and I can write code....so.....yeah.

I reserve the right to write this in whatever language I want. The goal is for this thing to be a static bunble I can serve
from AWS to help me structure my guitar practice routine. If you want to try it, knock yourself out. Happy to help!
